## 🧩 Datasets

* **`flowers.csv`**, **`iris.csv`**, and **`pca.csv`** contain datasets for ML model training and testing.
* Ensure the CSV files are properly formatted and located in the `csv files/` directory.

---

## 🖼️ Images

Images such as `car.jpg`, `flower.jpg`, and `men.jpg` are used for computer vision exercises like:

* Image reading and displaying using OpenCV
* Edge detection and filtering
* Feature extraction and color space transformations

---

## 🚀 How to Run

Run any Python program using:

```bash
python program1.py
```

or open it in **Jupyter Notebook** / **VS Code** for step-by-step execution.

Would you like me to customize the program descriptions (like specify what each `.py` file actually does in your lab)?  
If you share the purpose of each program, I can tailor the README to match your syllabus exactly.
